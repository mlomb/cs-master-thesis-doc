Runtime may be affected by other processes running on the machine, since it was my everyday computer. They are listed here for reference.

\caption{Weights of different neurons in the L1 layer, which are connected to features in \featureset{All} with different roles. The intensity represents the weight value, and the color represents the sign. The number is the feature index, specifically \featureset{VH} instead of \featureset{HV} (both are \featureset{All}), because it was prior to the first experiment. Refer to section \ref{sec:axis_encoding}.}
