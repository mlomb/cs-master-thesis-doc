\section{Feature sets (board encodings)}

\subsection{\mdseries\fs{Half-Compact}}

$\langle piece\_rank, piece\_type, piece\_color \rangle \oplus \langle piece\_file, piece\_type, piece\_color \rangle$

$(8*6*2)*2=192$ features

\subsection{\mdseries\fs{Half-Piece}}

$\langle piece\_square, piece\_type, piece\_color \rangle$

$64*6*2=768$ features

\subsection{\mdseries\fs{Half-Piece+Moves}}

\fs{HalfP} $\oplus \langle move\_from, move\_to \rangle$

$768 + 64*64=4864$ features

Not friendly to efficiently update the network. It is almost always better to do a full refresh on eval.

\subsection{\mdseries\fs{Half-King-Piece}}

$\langle side\_king\_square, piece\_square, piece\_type, piece\_color \rangle$ excl. king

$64*64*5*2=40960$ features

There are variations to this feature set, such as \fs{HalfKAv2} or notably \fs{HalfKAv2\_hm} that is currently the latest feature set used by Stockfish 16.1. I will not consider them in this work.

\subsection{\mdseries\fs{Half-Relative(H$|$V$|$HV)King-Piece}}


$\langle side\_king\_file - piece\_file + 7, side\_king\_rank - piece\_rank + 7, piece\_type, piece\_color \rangle$ excl. king

$15*15*5*2=2250$ features (for HV)

only H or only V have $8*15*5*2=1200$ features


\subsection{\mdseries\fs{Half-Top(PP)}}

Statistical feature set, blabla, wasted features blabla
