\subsection{Half-Piece}

\fs{HalfP}
$\langle piece\_square, piece\_type, piece\_color \rangle$

\subsection{Half-King-Piece}

\fs{HalfKP}
$\langle side\_king\_square, piece\_square, piece\_type, piece\_color \rangle$

There are variations to this feature set, such as \fs{HalfKAv2} or notably \fs{HalfKAv2\_hm} that is currently the latest feature set used by Stockfish 16.1 I will not consider them in this work.

\subsection{Half-Relative(H$|$V$|$HV)King-Piece}

\fs{HalfRelative(HV)KP}

\subsection{Half-Compact}

\fs{HalfC}
$\langle piece\_rank, piece\_type, piece\_color \rangle \cup \langle piece\_file, piece\_type, piece\_color \rangle$

\subsection{Half-Top(PP)}
